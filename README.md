# WRBB Spinitron & Icecast Listener Count

This script works by running the selenium web driver to navigate to both [spinitron](www.spinitron.com/WRBB/) and [icecast](http://129.10.161.130:8000/status.xsl) and gather the current show and listener count. 

## Installation

To install this script first run 
```bash
gem install selenium-webdrier
```

Then either download the chromedriver [here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) or if homebrew is installed, install it using the command

```
brew install chromedriver
```
